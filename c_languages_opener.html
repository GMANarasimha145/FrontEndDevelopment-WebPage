          <u>C, computer programming language developed in the early 1970s by American computer scientist Dennis M. Ritchie at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T Bell Laboratories)</u>. C was designed as a minimalist language to be used in writing operating systems for minicomputers, such as the DEC PDP 7, which had very limited memories compared with the mainframe computers of the period. The language was devised during 1969–73, alongside the early development of the UNIX operating system. It was based on CPL (Combined Programming Language), which had been first condensed into the B programming language—a stripped-down computer programming language—created in 1969–70 by Ken Thompson, an American computer scientist and a colleague of Ritchie. Ritchie subsequently rewrote and restored features from CPL to create C and eventually rewrote the UNIX operating system in the new language.C is an imperative procedural language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.</p>

      <i>HISTORY OF C LANGUAGE</i>

  </h1>
  <p style="font-size: 25px; text-indent:30; font-family: bold; background-image: url('    c_bg.jpeg'); color: whitesmoke;">Before learning anything, it is very necessary to know the history of what you are going to learn. The history of the C language is interesting to know. In the early 1970s, the C programming language was developed as a system implementation language for the emerging Unix operating system. It evolved a type structure from the typeless language BCPL; started on a small machine as a tool to better a minimal programming environment, it has become one of the most widely used languages today. In this article, we will discuss the history of the C language. To learn about the history of C language, let's first start with its root and early developments. The root of all modern languages is ALGOL (Algorithmic Language). ALGOL was the first computer programming language to use a block structure, and it was introduced in 1960. In 1967, Martin Richards developed a language called BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language). BCPL was derived from ALGOL. In 1970, Ken Thompson created a language using BCPL called B. Both BCPL and B programming languages were typeless. After that, C was developed using BCPL and B by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell lab in 1972. So, in terms of history of C language, it was used in mainly academic environments, but at long last with the release of many C compilers for commercial use and the increasing popularity of UNIX, it began to gain extensive support among professionals.

The instruction sets will only get executed when the evaluation of the condition turns out to be true. In case the evaluation of the condition is false, there will be an execution of a different instruction set. These are also known as decision control statements.

  <h3 style=" text-indent : 30;text-align: left;font-size: 25px; background-image: url('c_bg.jpeg'); color: whitesmoke;">The C language offers its users with a selection statement in various ways in case a program becomes difficult to read with an increased number of conditions. A switch statement is a multi-way type of selection statement that would resolve this issue. The switch declaration comes into play when more than three alternatives (conditions) exist in a program. This command then switches between all the available blocks on the basis of the expression value. Then, each block has a corresponding value with it.</h3>

    <u>Access Array of Elements:</u>
  </h1>
  <h3 class="d_highlight">Access the Elements of an Array To access an array element, refer to its index number. Array indexes start with 0: [0] is the first element. [1] is the second element, etc. This statement accesses the value of the first element [0] in myNumbers:</h3>

  <h2 class="b_highlight">MULTIDIMENTIONAL ARRAYS IN C</h2>
  <h3 class="d_highlight">if you want to store data as a tabular form, like a table with rows and columns, you need to get familiar with multidimensional arrays. A multidimensional array is basically an array of arrays. Arrays can have any number of dimensions. In this chapter, we will introduce the most common; two-dimensional arrays (2D).</h3>
  <h2>
    <u>Example:</u>
  </h2> <pre>
    <code>
      int matrix[2][3] = { {1, 4, 2}, {3, 6, 8} };

      printf(&quot;%d&quot;, matrix[0][2]);  // Outputs 2

  <h2 class="b_highlight">STRINGS IN C</h2>
  <h3 class="d_highlight">Strings are used for storing text/characters. For example, "Hello World" is a string of characters. Unlike many other programming languages, C does not have a String type to easily create string variables. Instead, you must use the char type and create an array of characters to make a string in C:</h3>
  <h2>
    <u>Example with Accessing: **</u>
  </h2> <pre>
          <code>
            char greetings[] = &quot;Hello World!&quot;;

  <h2 class="b_highlight">USER INPUT IN C</h2>
  <h3 class="d_highlight">To get user input, you can use the scanf() function:</h3>
  <h2>
    <u>Example: **</u>
  </h2> <pre>
        <code>
          // Create an integer variable that will store the number we get from the user
          int myNum;

          // Ask the user to type a number
          printf(&quot;Type a number: \n&quot;);

          // Get and save the number the user types
          scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;myNum);

          // Output the number the user typed

  <h2 class="b_highlight">FUNCTIONS IN C</h2>
  <h3 class="d_highlight">A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.</h3>
  <h1>
    <u>PREDEFINED FUNCTIONS IN C:</u>
  </h1>
  <h3 class="d_highlight">So it turns out you already know what a function is. You have been using it the whole time while studying this tutorial! For example, main() is a function, which is used to execute code, and printf() is a function; used to output/print text to the screen:</h3>
  <h2>
    <u>Example: **</u>
  </h2> <pre>
        <code>
          int main() {
            printf(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
            return 0;
          }
        </code>
      </pre>
  <h1>
    <u>USER DEFINED FUNCTION:</u>
  </h1>
  <h3 class="d_highlight">To create (often referred to as declare) your own function, specify the name of the function, followed by parentheses () and curly brackets {}:</h3>
  <h2>
    <u>Syntax: **</u>
  </h2> <pre>
        <code>
          void myFunction() {
          // code to be executed
          }
        </code>
      </pre>
  <h2>
    <u>Explanation: **</u>
  </h2>
  <h3 class="d_highlight">myFunction() is the name of the function void means that the function does not have a return value. You will learn more about return values later in the next chapter Inside the function (the body), add code that defines what the function should do</h3>
  <h1>
    <u>CALLING A FUNCTION:</u>
  </h1>
  <h3 class="d_highlight">Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use", and will be executed when they are called. To call a function, write the function's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon ; In the following example, myFunction() is used to print a text (the action), when it is called:</h3>
  <h2 class="b_highlight">CREATING POINTERS IN C</h2>
  <h3 class="d_highlight">You learned from the previous chapter, that we can get the memory address of a variable with the reference operator &:</h3>
  <h2>
    <u>Example: **</u>
  </h2> <pre>
            <code>
              int myAge = 43; // an int variable

              printf(&quot;%d&quot;, myAge);  // Outputs the value of myAge (43)
              printf(&quot;%p&quot;, &amp;myAge); // Outputs the memory address of myAge (0x7ffe5367e044)
            </code>
          </pre>
  <h3 class="d_highlight">In the example above, &myAge is also known as a pointer. A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable as its value. A pointer variable points to a data type (like int) of the same type, and is created with the * operator. The address of the variable you are working with is assigned to the pointer:</h3>
  <h2>
    <u>Example: **</u>
  </h2> <pre>
            <code>
              int myAge = 43;     // An int variable
              int* ptr = &amp;myAge;  // A pointer variable, with the name ptr, that stores the address of myAge

              // Output the value of myAge (43)
              printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, myAge);

              // Output the memory address of myAge (0x7ffe5367e044)
              printf(&quot;%p\n&quot;, &amp;myAge);

              // Output the memory address of myAge with the pointer (0x7ffe5367e044)
              printf(&quot;%p\n&quot;, ptr);
            </code>
          </pre>
  <h3 class="d_highlight">Create a pointer variable with the name ptr, that points to an int variable (myAge). Note that the type of the pointer has to match the type of the variable you're working with. Use the & operator to store the memory address of the myAge variable, and assign it to the pointer. Now, ptr holds the value of myAge's memory address.</h3>
  <h2 class="b_highlight">RECURSION IN C</h2>
  <h3 class="d_highlight">Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve. Recursion may be a bit difficult to understand. The best way to figure out how it works is to experiment with it.</h3>
  <h2>
    <u>Example: **</u>
  </h2>
  <h3 class="d_highlight">Adding two numbers together is easy to do, but adding a range of numbers is more complicated. In the following example, recursion is used to add a range of numbers together by breaking it down into the simple task of adding two numbers:</h3> <pre>
            <code>
              int sum(int k);

              int main() {
                int result = sum(10);
                printf(&quot;%d&quot;, result);
                return 0;
              }

              int sum(int k) {
                if (k &gt; 0) {
                  return k + sum(k - 1);
                } else {
                  return 0;
