          <u>Python is a widely-used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation.</u>It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code. In the late 1980s, history was about to be written. It was that time when working on Python started. Soon after that, Guido Van Rossum began doing its application-based work in December of 1989 at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) which is situated in the Netherlands. It was started firstly as a hobby project because he was looking for an interesting project to keep him occupied during Christmas. The programming language in which Python is said to have succeeded is ABC Programming Language, which had interfacing with the Amoeba Operating System and had the feature of exception handling. He had already helped to create ABC earlier in his career and he had seen some issues with ABC but liked most of the features. After that what he did was really very clever. He had taken the syntax of ABC, and some of its good features. It came with a lot of complaints too, so he fixed those issues completely and had created a good scripting language that had removed all the flaws. The inspiration for the name came from BBC’s TV Show – ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’, as he was a big fan of the TV show and also he wanted a short, unique and slightly mysterious name for his invention and hence he named it Python! He was the “Benevolent dictator for life” (BDFL) until he stepped down from the position as the leader on 12th July 2018. For quite some time he used to work for Google, but currently, he is working at Dropbox.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 25px; text-indent:30; font-family: bold; background-image: url('c_bg.jpeg'); color: whitesmoke;">The language was finally released in 1991. When it was released, it used a lot fewer codes to express the concepts, when we compare it with Java, C++ & C. Its design philosophy was quite good too. Its main objective is to provide code readability and advanced developer productivity. When it was released it had more than enough capability to provide classes with inheritance, several core data types exception handling and functions.</p>

      <i>HISTORY OF PYTHON LANGUAGE</i>

  </h1>
  <p style="font-size: 25px; text-indent:30; font-family: bold; background-image: url('    c_bg.jpeg'); color: whitesmoke;">The two of the most used versions has to Python 2.x & 3.x. There is a lot of competition between the two and both of them seem to have quite a number of different fanbases. For various purposes such as developing, scripting, generation, and software testing, this language is utilized. Due to its elegance and simplicity, top technology organizations like Dropbox, Google, Quora, Mozilla, Hewlett-Packard, Qualcomm, IBM, and Cisco have implemented Python. Python has come a long way to become the most popular coding language in the world. Python has just turned 30 and just recently at pycon22(python conference) a new feature was released by Anaconda foundation it’s known as pyscript with this now python can be written and run in the browser like javascript which was previously not possible, but it still has that unknown charm & X factor which can be clearly seen from the fact that Google users have consistently searched for Python much more than they have searched for Kim Kardashian, Donald Trump, Tom Cruise, etc. Python has been an inspiration for many other coding languages such as Ruby, Cobra, Boo, CoffeeScript ECMAScript, Groovy, Swift Go, OCaml, Julia, etc. He had taken the syntax of ABC, and some of its good features. It came with a lot of complaints too, so he fixed those issues completely and had created a good scripting language that had removed all the flaws. The inspiration for the name came from BBC’s TV Show – ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’, as he was a big fan of the TV show and also he wanted a short, unique and slightly mysterious name for his invention and hence he named it Python! He was the “Benevolent dictator for life” (BDFL) until he stepped down from the position as the leader on 12th July 2018.He had taken the syntax of ABC, and some of its good features.</p>

    <u>List Items:</u>List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values. List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
    <u>Ordered:</u>When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change. If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.
    <u>Changeable:</u>The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.
    <u>Allow Duplicates:</u>Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:</h3>

A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. Set Items Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.
    <u>Unordered:</u>Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order. Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.
