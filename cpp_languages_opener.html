          <u>The C++ language is an object-oriented programming language & is a combination of both low-level & high-level language – a Middle-Level Language. The programming language was created, designed & developed by a Danish Computer Scientist – Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Telephone Laboratories (now known as Nokia Bell Labs) in Murray Hill, New Jersey. As he wanted a flexible & a dynamic language which was similar to C with all its features, but with additionality of active type checking, basic inheritance, default functioning argument, classes, inlining, etc. and hence C with Classes (C++) was launched. C++ was initially known as “C with classes, ” and was renamed C++ in 1983. ++ is shorthand for adding one to variety in programming; therefore C++ roughly means that “one higher than C.” The C++ programming language has a history going back to 1979, when Bjarne Stroustrup was doing work for his Ph.D. thesis. One of the languages Stroustrup had the opportunity to work with was a language called Simula, which as the name implies is a language primarily designed for simulations. The Simula 67 language - which was the variant that Stroustrup worked with - is regarded as the first language to support the object-oriented programming paradigm. Stroustrup found that this paradigm was very useful for software development, however the Simula language was far too slow for practical use. Shortly thereafter, he began work on "C with Classes", which as the name implies was meant to be a superset of the C language. His goal was to add object-oriented programming into the C language, which was and still is a language well-respected for its portability without sacrificing speed or low-level functionality. His language included classes, basic inheritance, inlining, default function arguments, and strong type checking in addition to all the features of the C language.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 25px; text-indent:30; font-family: bold; background-image: url('c_bg.jpeg'); color: whitesmoke;">In 1983, the name of the language was changed from C with Classes to C++. The ++ operator in the C language is an operator for incrementing a variable, which gives some insight into how Stroustrup regarded the language. Many new features were added around this time, the most notable of which are virtual functions, function overloading, references with the & symbol, the const keyword, and single-line comments using two forward slashes (which is a feature taken from the language BCPL). In 1985, Stroustrup's reference to the language entitled The C++ Programming Language was published. That same year, C++ was implemented as a commercial product. The language was not officially standardized yet, making the book a very important reference. The language was updated again in 1989 to include protected and static members, as well as inheritance from several classes.</p>

      <i>HISTORY OF C++ LANGUAGE</i>
    </u>
  </h1>
  <p style="font-size: 25px; text-indent:30; font-family: bold; background-image: url('    c_bg.jpeg'); color: whitesmoke;">In 1998, the C++ standards committee published the first international standard for C++ ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which would be informally known as C++98. The Annotated C++ Reference Manual was said to be a large influence in the development of the standard. The Standard Template Library, which began its conceptual development in 1979, was also included. In 2003, the committee responded to multiple problems that were reported with their 1998 standard, and revised it accordingly. The changed language was dubbed C++03. In 2005, the C++ standards committee released a technical report (dubbed TR1) detailing various features they were planning to add to the latest C++ standard. The new standard was informally dubbed C++0x as it was expected to be released sometime before the end of the first decade. Ironically, however, the new standard would not be released until mid-2011. Several technical reports were released up until then, and some compilers began adding experimental support for the new features. In mid-2011, the new C++ standard (dubbed C++11) was finished. The Boost library project made a considerable impact on the new standard, and some of the new modules were derived directly from the corresponding Boost libraries. Some of the new features included regular expression support (details on regular expressions may be found here), a comprehensive randomization library, a new C++ time library, atomics support, a standard threading library (which up until 2011 both C and C++ were lacking), a new for loop syntax providing functionality similar to foreach loops in certain other languages, the auto keyword, new container classes, better support for unions and array-initialization lists, and variadic templates.In 2005, the C++ standards committee released a technical report (dubbed TR1) detailing various features they were planning to add to the latest C++ standard.

        <br>Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>OOP is faster and easier to execute</li>
          <li>OOP provides a clear structure for the programs</li>
          <li>OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug</li>
          <li>OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time</li>

      <h3 class="d_highlight">C++ is an object-oriented programming language.
        <br>Everything in C++ is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods.
        <br>For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.
        <br>Attributes and methods are basically variables and functions that belongs to the class. These are often referred to as "class members".
        <br>A class is a user-defined data type that we can use in our program, and it works as an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.</h3>

        <ul>

          <li>Outside class definition</li>In the following example, we define a function inside the class, and we name it "myMethod".</h3>

</code></pre>
      <h3 class="d_highlight">To define a function outside the class definition, you have to declare it inside the class and then define it outside of the class. This is done by specifiying the name of the class, followed the scope resolution :: operator, followed by the name of the function:</h3>

      <h2 class="b_highlight">C++ Access Specifiers</h2>
      <h3 class="d_highlight">The public keyword is an access specifier. Access specifiers define how the members (attributes and methods) of a class can be accessed. In the example above, the members are public - which means that they can be accessed and modified from outside the code.
        <br>However, what if we want members to be private and hidden from the outside world? In C++, there are three access specifiers:
        <table border="1" align="center">
          <tr>
            <td>public</td>
            <td>members are accessible from outside the class</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>private</td>
            <td>members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>protected</td>
            <td>members cannot be accessed from outside the class, however, they can be accessed in inherited classes. You will learn more about Inheritance later.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <br>In the following example, we demonstrate the differences between public and private members:</h3>
      <h2>
        <u>Example: **</u>
      </h2>
<pre><code>
  class MyClass {
  public:    // Public access specifier
    int x;   // Public attribute
  private:   // Private access specifier
    int y;   // Private attribute
};

int main() {
  MyClass myObj;
  myObj.x = 25;  // Allowed (public)
  myObj.y = 50;  // Not allowed (private)
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>
      <h2 class="b_highlight">C++ Encapsulation</h2>
      <h3 class="d_highlight">The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must declare class variables/attributes as private (cannot be accessed from outside the class). If you want others to read or modify the value of a private member, you can provide public get and set methods.</h3>
      <h2>
        <u>Example: **</u>
      </h2>
<pre><code>
  #include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

class Employee {
  private:
    // Private attribute
    int salary;

  public:
    // Setter
    void setSalary(int s) {
      salary = s;
    }
    // Getter
    int getSalary() {
      return salary;
    }
};

int main() {
  Employee myObj;
  myObj.setSalary(50000);
  cout &lt;&lt; myObj.getSalary();
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>
      <h2>
        <u>Example Explained: **</u>
      </h2>
      <h3 class="d_highlight">The salary attribute is private, which have restricted access.
        <br>The public setSalary() method takes a parameter (s) and assigns it to the salary attribute (salary = s).
        <br>The public getSalary() method returns the value of the private salary attribute.
        <br>Inside main(), we create an object of the Employee class. Now we can use the setSalary() method to set the value of the private attribute to 50000. Then we call the getSalary() method on the object to return the value.</h3>
      <h2 class="b_highlight">C++ Inheritance</h2>
      <h3 class="d_highlight">In C++, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:

          <li>base class (parent) - the class being inherited from</li>
        </ul>To inherit from a class, use the : symbol.
        <br>In the example below, the Car class (child) inherits the attributes and methods from the Vehicle class (parent):</h3>

          <h3 class="d_highlight">When executing C++ code, different errors can occur: coding errors made by the programmer, errors due to wrong input, or other unforeseeable things.
            <br>When an error occurs, C++ will normally stop and generate an error message. The technical term for this is: C++ will throw an exception (throw an error).</h3>
          <h1>
            <u>C++ try and catch</u>
          </h1>
          <h3 class="d_highlight">Exception handling in C++ consist of three keywords: try, throw and catch:
            <br>The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.
            <br>The throw keyword throws an exception when a problem is detected, which lets us create a custom error.
            <br>The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.
            <br>The try and catch keywords come in pairs:</h3>
          <h2>
            <u>Syntax:</u>
          </h2>
<pre><code>
try {
  // Block of code to try
  throw exception; // Throw an exception when a problem arise
}
catch () {
  // Block of code to handle errors
}

    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Access granted - you are old enough.&quot;;

          <h2>
            <u>Example Explained: **</u>
          </h2>
          <h3 class="d_highlight">We use the try block to test some code: If the age variable is less than 18, we will throw an exception, and handle it in our catch block.
            <br>In the catch block, we catch the error and do something about it. The catch statement takes a parameter: in our example we use an int variable (myNum) (because we are throwing an exception of int type in the try block (age)), to output the value of age.
            <br>If no error occurs (e.g. if age is 20 instead of 15, meaning it will be be greater than 18), the catch block is skipped:
            <br>You can also use the throw keyword to output a reference number, like a custom error number/code for organizing purposes:</h3>
